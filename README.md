## About

Built for VARIANT brains, by VARIANT brains.

Because sometimes you need a project planner that understands that:
- You'll hyperfocus for 6 hours straight
- Then have zero energy the next day
- Time estimates are always wrong
- You need to see the big picture AND the details
- Motivation comes from momentum, not discipline
- Your brain works differently, and that's not a bug—it's a feature
